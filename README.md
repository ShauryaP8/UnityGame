This is a game I am working on


I just made the first alpha with some base game mechanics. This is not a shippable project yet but merely just a test of the idea. All this project has currently is a lose 
state and win state. A player, collision detection, some really basic animations I made in 2 minutes, and some basic scripts mainly the Game manager and player movement being
the most "robust" in terms of content. This is my first time using a C based langauge so if the code is horrible please excuse as I am going to keep refactoring this as time
goes on.

The Game is currently called CUBERUNNER(Took 2 minutes to come up with that) and it is meant to mimic a simple mobile type game for wasting time. All you do currently is go through 
3 Levels which are the exact same I just wanted to test Unity's Scene Management and how it works. It has a Main Menu and a Credits screen.

In the furture you can expect this aplha version to be gone and replaced with a more complete version which I will develop over the next too weeks.

Updates may include:

- A endless mode
- Skins for the cube
- More levels in the base mode
- A highscore and leader board
- Music
- Better graphics
- Maybe some post processing
- Collectiables
- A boss fight
- Power ups
- And a shop to buy upgrades for your cube

I will once again emphasies that this project is in a really early stage as I have just made Alpha one today in the span of about 4 hours. 

As the 2 week time period goes on (Starting Wed), I will be upadting this repo with all of the updates and logs for the game Including ScreenShots of the current progress.
By the end of the 2 week period you should be able to go to an itch.io page and play the game with all the features listed above.
